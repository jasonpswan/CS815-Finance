# This is done at this stage as we have three years worth of entries and to assess each one on a daily change would prove fruitless

# The square root of the variance (AKA the Standard Deviation - Ïƒ) is also calculated
# The purpose of this is to find how much the returns differ from the mean
# The standard deviation is a measure of how much the values differ from the mean

# The next step is to write a function which will satsifty the predefined constraints
# The constraints for this problem are threefold:
# The weights must all be greater than zero (no shorting of stocks)
# No asset can hold a weight of one, as this would not be a portfolio
# The weights must all sum to 1 (or close enough to it that it is neglible)

# Now that we have the sharpe function (which takes care of risk & return),
# as well as the penalty function which ensures the constraints are met,
# the final part of the problem is to combine them in to the function which

# we must multiply it by -1 in or that it becomes an optimisation problem.
